and now  for step4sec1ChemicalAmt1 using the below excel formula
=IFERROR(IF(C25*Water_Litres_Dyeing>=1000,ROUND(C25*Water_Litres_Dyeing/1000,1)&Standards!$D$174,ROUND(C25*Water_Litres_Dyeing,1)),"")
D174 is kgs,
and C25 is the value gotten by Number(step4sec1ChemicalGpl({mode: "prepareToDye",selectedColour,scouring })).toFixed(1),


and then step4sec1ChemicalAmt2
using the formula, =IFERROR(IF(C26*Water_Litres_Dyeing>=1000,ROUNDUP
(C26*Water_Litres_Dyeing/1000,0)&Standards!$D$174,ROUNDUP(C26*Water_Litres_Dyeing,0)),"")
where C26 is the value gotten by, Number(step4sec1ChemicalGpl({mode: "dyeing", selectedColour, b26Title })).toFixed(1),




if you can combine the 2 exportable functions to make them work, do it and give it.
